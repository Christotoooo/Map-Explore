            <h3>Displaying A Terrain Map</h3>
            <p>
To display a particular terrain map, you should use the same command you used to display the demonstration map, but follow “…/Explore” with the path to your terrain file. If you moved Explore.java to your working directory and recompiled there (as suggested at the end of the
installation instructions), then you should be able to display any description file located in your working directory by entering the command
            </p>    
   <pre> Explore &lt; terrain file name &gt;</pre>
            <p>You can also use a relative path or an absolute path in place of the simple filename. For example if you have created a “terrains” directory in your Explore working directory, then you could load a file (say “myTerrain.txt”) from the terrains directory with</br></p>    
   <pre> Explore terrains/myTerrain.txt</pre>
            <p>
            If neither of these options is convenient for you, there are other installation options that might be. Contact the dissussion board or a developer friend for details.
